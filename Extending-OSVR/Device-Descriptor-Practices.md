This is an ad-hoc collection of practices for setting up device descriptors, in particular good semantic alias trees for devices.

**Syntax Note**: The json semantic alias syntax of the form

```json
"hat": {
    "$target": "analog/4",
    "up": "button/12"
}
```

indicates that the partial/relative path `hat` is an alias for `analog/4`, while `hat/up` is an alias for `button/12`.
The `$target` key is intentional use of a reserved character (it cannot be in a valid path) to be able to set alias sources for both `hat` and `hat/up` (in this example).

## For controller buttons that are labeled, make the semantic alias the label, in lowercase.

e.g.
```json
"a": "button/0",
"b": "button/1",
"x": "button/2",
"y": "button/3",
"start": "button/6",
"back": "button/7"
```

## Give each joystick its own "directory" with a path entry for each axis.

Include the button, if applicable - this means you could theoretically have, in a joystick with twist and a push-down button (a combination I've never seen but which undoubtedly exists somewhere)

```json
"joystick": {
    "x": "analog/0",
    "y": "analog/1",
    "rotate": "analog/2",
    "button": "button/8"
}
```

## For Point-of-View "hat" inputs, have an entry named "hat" that points to the heading, and nest the buttons, if available, inside.

Heading values are analog, and conventionally -1 if no input/centered, 0 for north/up, 45 for northeast/up and right, etc.

```json
"hat": {
    "$target": "analog/4",
    "up": "button/12",
    "right": "button/13",
    "down": "button/14",
    "left": "button/15"
}
```
## When inputs are related, group in paths.

A good example of this is taken from the descriptor of the "Futaba InterLink Elite", a controller that resembles an RC airplane controller. Its joysticks have specific meaning for their axes - throttle, rudder, etc. - and those meanings also have corresponding "trim" buttons typically used to adjust the effective resting point (yes, I know this is an oversimplification). Here's a snippet of the descriptor:

```json
"rudder": {
    "$target": "analog/0",
    "trim": {
        "right": "button/12",
        "left": "button/13"
    }
}
```

## If your device takes two hands to operate or is otherwise not intended for multiple use, suggest automatic alias to `controller`

That is, if you're configuring a generic gamepad or joystick, you probably want this general format in your descriptor:

```json
"semantic": {
    /* your semantic aliases here */
},
"automaticAliases": {
    "/controller": "semantic/*"
}
```

The `automaticAliases` section shown in that example will recursively mirror the semantic tree of your plugin under the "global" `/controller` path, if the user's path tree does not already have such aliases.

This should **not** be done if your controller is explicitly single-handed or might be used with one in each hand - in that case, let the user/configurator set up the appropriate global aliases.

## Check similar devices' descriptors for reference

While not all descriptors are guaranteed to be of the highest theoretical purity, they do give an indication of existing practice, especially when multiple descriptors are considered.

See <http://osvr.github.io/compatibility/> for a syndicated/aggregated list of device compatibility that includes links to the device descriptors associated with each entry.

## Use the Device Descriptor Editor at least as a validation step.
While it's not a perfect editor (it's mainly auto-generated based on the JSON Schema) and you might prefer composing your descriptor in a text or JSON editor of your choosing, do at least run your descriptor through the web-based Device Descriptor editor to clean up formatting, easily update the timestamp, and catch some classes of typos.
